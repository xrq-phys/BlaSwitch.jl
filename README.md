BLAS Switcher tool for Julia

## Motivation
To link Julia to SVE-enabled math library on Post-K. That's it. [BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis) is just for linking tests, though I like BLIS very much.

## License
I was to license this "installer" under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net), but it seems conflict with [MKL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/MKL.jl)'s MIT (*Really*?) or agreement concerning usage of the Post-K (Fugaku) computer. So anyway I'm currently putting my name under it with a [Mozilla Public License](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL).
